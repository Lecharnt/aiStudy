Problem 1: Determine whether the sequences below converge, if so find lim
n→∞an. (a) an = n2 + 5
2n2 + 3n + 1
(b) an = n2 −3n + 7
2n −1

Solution:
(a) We use the ratio test to determine convergence.

Let L be the limit as n approaches infinity of:

(n2 + 5)/(2n2 + 3n + 1)

Simplifying the expression:

L = (n2 + 5)/(2n2 + 3n + 1)

L = (1 + 5/n2)/(2 + 3/n)

As n approaches infinity, the denominator approaches infinity, and the numerator approaches 1. Therefore, L approaches 1. Since L is between -1 and 1, the sequence converges.

(b) We use the ratio test to determine convergence.

Let L be the limit as n approaches infinity of:

(n2 −3n + 7)/(2n −1)

Simplifying the expression:

L = (n2 −3n + 7)/(2n −1)

L = (n2 −3n + 7)/(2n −1)

L = (n2 −3n)/(2n −1) - 7/(2n −1)

As n approaches infinity, the denominator approaches infinity, and the numerator approaches infinity. Therefore, L approaches infinity. Since L is greater than 1, the sequence diverges.

(c) We use the ratio test to determine convergence.

Let L be the limit as n approaches infinity of:

2n/(n2 + 3)

Simplifying the expression:

L = 2/n - 3/(n2 + 3)

As n approaches infinity, the first term approaches 0, and the second term approaches 0. Therefore, L approaches 0. Since L is between -1 and 1, the sequence converges.

Final Answer:
(a)
