MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING WITH NEGATIVES
Some examples:
Fractions
LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE
The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a
multiple of all the given numbers.
For example, the LCM of 5 and 6 is 30, since 5 and 6 have no
factors in common.
GREATEST COMMON FACTOR
The GCF of a set of numbers is the largest number that can
be evenly divided into each of the given numbers.
For example, the GCF of 24 and 27 is 3, since both 24 and
27 are divisible by 3, but they are not both divisible by any
numbers larger than 3.
FRACTIONS
Fractions are another way to express division. The top num-
ber of a fraction is called the numerator, and the bottom
number is called the denominator.
ADDING AND SUBTRACTING FRACTIONS
Fractions must have the same denominator before they can
be added or subtracted.

Rates, Ratios, Proportions,
and Percents
RATES AND RATIOS
A rate is a comparison of two quantities with different units.
For example, a car that travels 110 miles in 2 hours is mov-
ing at a rate of 110 miles/2 hours or 55 mph.
A ratio is a comparison of two quantities with the same
units. For example, a class with 23 students has a
student–teacher ratio of 23:1 or
.
PROPORTIONS
A proportion is a statement in which two ratios or rates are
equal.
An example of a proportion is the following statement:
30 dollars is to 5 hours as 60 dollars is to 10 hours.
This is written
.
A typical proportion problem will have one unknown 
quantity, such as
.
We can solve this equation by cross multiplying as shown:
.
So, it takes 60 minutes to walk 3 miles.
PERCENTS
A percent is the number of parts out of 100. To write a per-
cent as a fraction, divide by 100 and drop the percent sign. 
For example,
.
To write a fraction as a percent, first check to see if the
denominator is 100. If it is not, write the fraction as an
equivalent fraction with 100 in the denominator. Then the
numerator becomes the percent. For example,
.
To find a percent of a quantity, multiply the percent by the
quantity.
For example, 30% of 5 is
.
30
100 # 5 = 150
100 = 3

5 = 80
100 = 80%
57% = 57

Equivalent fractions are found by multiplying the numerator
and denominator of the fraction by the same number. In the
previous example,

MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING FRACTIONS
When multiplying and dividing fractions, a common
denominator is not needed. To multiply, take the product 
of the numerators and the product of the denominators:
To divide fractions, invert the second fraction and then 
multiply the numerators and denominators:
Some examples:
REDUCING FRACTIONS
To reduce a fraction, divide both the numerator and denom-
inator by common factors. In the last example,

A mixed number has two parts: a whole number part and a
fractional part. An example of a mixed number is

Percents to Decimals and 
Decimals to Percents
To change a number from a percent to a decimal, divide by
100 and drop the percent sign:
58% = 58/100 = 0.58.
To change a number from a decimal to a percent, multiply
by 100 and add the percent sign:
0.73 = .73
100 = 73%.
Simple Interest
Given the principal (amount of money to be borrowed or
invested), interest rate, and length of time, the amount of
interest can be found using the formula
where
.
For example, find the amount of simple interest on a $3800
loan at an annual rate of 5.5% for 5 years:
.
The amount of interest is $1045.
Scientific Notation
Scientific notation is a convenient way to express very large
or very small numbers. A number in this form is written as
, where 
and n is an integer. For
example, 
and 
are expressed 
in scientific notation.
To change a number from scientific notation to a number
without exponents, look at the power of ten. If that number is
positive, move the decimal point to the right. If it is negative,
move the decimal point to the left. The number tells you how
many places to move the decimal point.
For example,
.
To change a number to scientific notation, move the deci-
mal point so it is to the right of the first nonzero digit. If the
decimal point is moved n places to the left and this makes
the number smaller, n is positive; otherwise, n is negative. If
the decimal point is not moved, n is 0.
For example,
.
0.0000216 = 2.16 * 10-5
3.97 * 103 = 3970
-1.2 * 10-4
3.62 * 105

a * 10n
 I = 13800210.0552152 = 1045
 t = 5 years 
 r = 5.5% = 0.055 
 p = $3800 
t = time period
r = percentage rate of interest
p = principal
I = interest 1dollar amount2
I = p # r # t
*
Decimal Numbers
The numbers after the decimal point represent fractions with
denominators that are powers of 10. The decimal point sep-
arates the whole number part from the fractional part.
For example, 0.9 represents 
.
ADDING AND SUBTRACTING DECIMAL NUMBERS
To add or subtract decimal numbers, line up the numbers so
that the decimal points are aligned. Then add or subtract as
usual, keeping the decimal point in the same place.
For example,
MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING DECIMAL NUMBERS
To multiply decimal numbers, multiply them as though they
were whole numbers. The number of decimal places in the
product is the sum of the number of decimal places in the
factors. For example,
is
To divide decimal numbers, first make sure the divisor is a
whole number. If it is not, move the decimal place to the right
(multiply by 10, 100, and so on) to make it a whole number.
Then move the decimal point the same number of places in
the dividend.
For example,
.
The decimal point in the answer is placed directly above the
new decimal point in the dividend.

MULTIPLYING AND DIVIDING IN SCIENTIFIC NOTATION
To multiply or divide numbers in scientific notation, we can
change the order and grouping, so that we multiply or divide
first the decimal parts and then the powers of 10. For example,
Statistics
There are several ways to study a list of data.
Mean, or average, is the sum of all the data values divided by
the number of values.
Median is the number that separates the list of data into two
equal parts. To find the median, list the data in order from
smallest to largest. If the number of data is odd, the median is
the middle number. If the number of data is even, the median
is the average of the two middle numbers.
Mode is the number in the list that occurs the most fre-
quently. There can be more than one mode.
For example, consider the following list of test scores:
{87, 56, 69, 87, 93, 82}
To find the mean, first add:
.
Then divide by 6:
.
The mean score is 79.
To find the median, first list the data in order:
56, 69, 82, 87, 87, 93.
Since there is an even number of data, we take the average
of 82 and 87:
.
The median score is 84.5.
The mode is 87, since this number appears twice and each
of the other numbers appears only once.
Distance Formula
Given the rate at which you are traveling and the length of
time you will be traveling, the distance can be found by
using the formula
where
t = time
r = rate
d = distance
d = r # t
82 + 87

= 169

87 + 56 + 69 + 87 + 93 + 82 = 474

 = 13.7 * 2.52 # 110-3 * 1082 
 
13.7 * 10-32 # 12.5 * 1082

Geometry
The perimeter of a geometric figure is the distance around it
or the sum of the lengths of its sides.
The perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2
times the width:
The perimeter of a square is 4 times the length of a side:
Area is always expressed in square units, since it is two-
dimensional.
The formula for area of a rectangle is
.
The formula for area of a square is
or
.
The area of a triangle is one-half the product of the height
and base:
The sum of all three angles in any triangle always equals
180 degrees.
A right triangle is a triangle with a 
(right) angle. The
hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite the right
angle.

CIRCLES
Area: 
Circumference: 
where d is the diameter, r is the radius, or half the diameter,
and 
is approximately 3.14 or

A circle has an angle of 360 degrees.
A straight line has an angle of 180 degrees.
Algebraic Terms
Variable: A variable is a letter that represents a number
because the number is unknown or because it can change.
For example, the number of days until your vacation
changes every day, so it could be represented by a
variable, x.
Constant: A constant is a term that does not change. For
example, the number of days in the week, 7, does not
change, so it is a constant. 
Expression: An algebraic expression consists of constants,
variables, numerals and at least one operation. For example,
is an expression. 
Equation: An equation is basically a mathematical sentence
indicating that two expressions are equal. For example,
is an equation.
Solution: A number that makes an equation true is a
solution to that equation. For example, in using the above
equation,
